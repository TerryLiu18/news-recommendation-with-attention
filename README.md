# News-Recommendation-with-Attention

![news_rec](assets/news_rec.jpeg)

This is the final assignment for course CSE258. The project works on the problem of news recommendation. In the first part, we conduct a concise introduction and survey on news recommendations, in which we define the problem and introduce the methods and techniques of some latest algorithms. In the second part, we implemented some selected algorithms with attention mechanisms to evaluate their performances.
